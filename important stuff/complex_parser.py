# maybe separate this into 3 files, quadratic, trigonometry, and factoring

# things I want this to do:

# convert quadratic equations between standard form and vertex form
# give me all the points of interest for a quadratic equation, i.e. vertex, AOS, direction of opening, zeroes, y-int, 
# maybe graphing equations, use MathPlotLib for this because it's based

# give me outputs for sine law and both cosine laws, and maybe more

# factor equations, i.e. simple trinomials, complex trinomials, perfect square trinomials, difference of square trinomials,
