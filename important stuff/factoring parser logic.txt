for a FACTORING



logic planning:

    identifying length:

        order all of the terms correctly, exponent value first, alphabetical order second. i.e. 2x^3 + 3y^3 - 7x^2 + 5y^2 - 2xy + 3x + 5y

        add 'like' terms

        count the number of '+' and '-' signs and add one to determine the number of terms



    if it's a binomial:

        factor out GCF if there is one

            check if every term shares a variable to determine if one can be factored out

            find factors by dividing each term by every number <= its value and add that number to a list

            check if every list shares one or more numbers

            pick the largest number and factor it out of every term

            put the factored number outside brackets



        difference of squares:

            the terms are subtracted

            both can be square-rooted

            square root each number and put them within the correct brackets




    how to identify what kind of trinomial it is:

        factor out GCF if there is one

        simple trinomial:

            if 'a' has no coefficient and is squared

            find all factors of 'c'

            find what factors of 'c' add up to 'b'

            separate them and put them within the correct brackets



        perfect square trinomial:

            square root of 'a' and 'c' have no decimals, and 2ac = b

            square root 'a' and 'c', and put them within brackets and square the brackets

        

        complex trinomial:

            'a' has a coefficient and it isn't a PST

            find all factors of 'ac' 

            find what factors of 'ac' add up to 'b'

            pair factors of 'b' with 'a' and 'c'

            use factors to find what numbers pair up best

            factor out GCF from each pair, and group the factors next to the factored pairs



    polynomials:

        longer than trinomial
